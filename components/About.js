          <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
          <p>
            I decided to change my career since November 2020. Previously I was
            an Admin and Graduated from Airlangga University with Bachelor
            Economics Degree. I started learning to code, because i'd like to
            design, build things, and solve problems. Currently I am looking for
            an entry-level position to begin my career as a junior front-end
            developer in a professional organization to contribute and apply
            what I have learned and expand my learnings and skills.
